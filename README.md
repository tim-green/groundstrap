## Description
Groundstrap is based on the Understrap framework by Howard Development & Consulting. 

It has been changed to suit my own needs like a major change in folder structure. If you come across this particular framework and wanting to use it, you can. 

Like mention above this framework has major changes to it.  I would highly recommend that you use the original Understrap if you want a good framework plus it probably get updated way more.
